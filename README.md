# moonlight.sh

## What is new

- Now you don't need to be root to run this script (still need to provide your password!)
- Refactored the code, now it's a little bit easier to maintain since it's function based
- The script can be run from anywhere in the system now, not only $HOME!
- Now you can choose your sound device (HDMI or Audio Jack) 
- Created 3 new menu entries: 

    1 - This (moonlight.sh) script, 
    
    2 - Change sound out to HDMI
    
    3 - Change sound out to Audio jack
    
- Created a (crude) command line interface. Now you can pass a number as an argument for this script
- Now there's some what of a error handling, so if something happens along the way you'll actually see it
- It'll use the debian strech repo, so no more libssl1.0 errors when installing (need to test this in a new system)


# To-Do
- Controller mapping (it's not a priority, since most controllers work out-of-the-box)

The Install &amp; Setup Script for Moonlight within RetroPie 4.2+ from **TechWizTime**

This script will install the Steam Streaming application Moonlight on your Raspberry Pi. I highly recommend using the latest version of RetroPie (currently at 4.3).

## What does this do
This script currently will do the following:
- Install Moonlight
- Create Launch Scripts for 720p 30fps, 720p 60ps, 1080p 30fps, 1080p 60fps
- Pair With GameStream on PC
- Setup a Steam Menu in RetroPie

## How to use this
In RetroPie, go to the Command Line and type the following to download the script:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klubas/moonlight-retropie/master/moonlight.sh
```
```
sudo chmod +x moonlight.sh
```
Then run the script:
```
sudo ./moonlight.sh
```

## If you get a TLS or SSL Error
Sometimes, this can happen when trying to wget the script above. If it does, try this wget command instead
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klubas/moonlight-retropie/master/moonlight.sh  --no-check
```

And if you are feeling particulary lazy, here's a shortlink via my website
```
wget https://techwiztime.com/moonlight.sh  --no-check
```
## Acknowledgements
@etgrieco - Thanks for fixing the script when the mapping broke!
