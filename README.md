The Install &amp; Setup Script for Moonlight within RetroPie 4.2+ from **TechWizTime**

This script will install the Steam Streaming application Moonlight on your Raspberry Pi. I highly recommend using the latest version of RetroPie (currently at 4.2).

## What does this do
This script currently will do the following:
- Install Moonlight
- Create a Controller Map
- Create Launch Scripts for 720p 30fps, 720p 60ps, 1080p 30fps, 1080p 60fps
- Pair With GameStream on PC
- Setup a Steam Menu in RetroPie

## How to use this
In RetroPie, go to the Command Line and type the following to download the script:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechWizTime/moonlight-retropie/master/moonlight.sh
```
```
sudo chmod +x moonlight.sh
```
Then run the script:
```
sudo ./moonlight.sh
```

## If you get a TLS or SSL Error
Sometimes, this can happen when trying to wget the script above. If it does, try this wget command instead
```
wget http://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechWizTime/moonlight-retropie/master/moonlight.sh
```
